# 🧠 MLOps Learning Journey — Swastik Dasgupta

Welcome to my **MLOps & AI Deployment Learning Journey**!  
This repository documents my **4-week deep dive** into building, deploying, and managing machine learning models using modern tools like **PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker, MLflow, and Azure ML**.

> 🚀 Goal: Become internship-ready by mastering the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle — from model training to scalable deployment.
